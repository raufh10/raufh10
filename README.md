### Hi my name is Rauf Hamidy 👋

Starting to learn Python for the first time to do web scraping. Became interested in the data world after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. After that, I began to learn Python 🐍 intensively and started taking data analyst courses 📊. Currently working as a data analyst at sunset land in Lombok 🌅, and in my free time, I am working on improving my web scraping tools.
